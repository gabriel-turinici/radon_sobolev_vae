# radon_sobolev_vae
Implementation of the Radon-Sobolev Variational Auto-Encoder as described in  arXiv:1911.13135

Published version: Neural Networks Volume 141, September 2021, Pages 294-305

Repository contains: the implementation of the Radon-Sobolev VAE in one file and the computation of some utility functions related to the Radon-Sobolev distance on the other side.

The file "simple_rs_vae_v2.py" contains a faster implementation of the Radon-Sobolev VAE (no comparison with other norms) that also can load other data (such as 1D data).
